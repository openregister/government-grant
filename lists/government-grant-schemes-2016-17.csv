The outcome of these deliberations will see a new operating model being established from April 2017 including the establishment of a National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) and the current Presidential model replaced by a Chair who would be a full time, The current four CFOA Directorates would be replaced by a number of co-ordinating committees operating at a strategic level and reflecting the wider fire reform programme.

The Multi-agency Statutory Guidance for the Conduct of Domestic Homicide Reviews has been updated to take account of changes since the guidance was last revised in 2013. The revised guidance emphasises the importance of involving family and friends in reviews; reiterates the need to ensure the review panel composition has a sufficiently diverse mix of statutory and voluntary sector representation, as well as relevant expertise; and provides improved templates to help standardise the structure of reports. The former Home Secretary committed to oversee the delivery of the recommendations made by HMIC in their 2015 Inspection of the Police Response to domestic abuse. One of the recommendations was that by September 2016, the Home Office should ensure that conclusions from DHRs are shared swiftly and effectively with police forces, Police and Crime Commissioners and domestic abuse practitioners. We have also published the key findings from a study of a sample of DHRs undertaken by Home Office researchers (available on the link below). Since April 2011, when DHRs were put on a statutory footing, there have been in excess of 400 DHR reports submitted to the Home Office to be quality assured by a panel of experts from the statutory and voluntary sectors. DHRs provide a rich source of information on the nature of domestic homicide, the context in which it occurs and, most importantly, the lessons that can be learned from the tragic event. The aim of this piece of work was to encourage local areas to embed the learning from this report, share best practice and consider improvements to local practice, policies, operational processes and services to safeguard victims and prevent domestic homicide.","70,000",01/04/16,31/03/17,1,General Grants - Competed,Civil Society,3.

If the Police Authorities do not receive this grant funding they will not have provision to upgrade their control rooms and will not be able to move over to the new system before the Airwave system is shut down in December 2019. It is therefore essential all Police forces receive this grant funding in order to facilitate a smooth transition to the new ESN system. The grant funding for control room upgrades was top sliced from the main Police Grant that went out to all PCC?s this year on the understanding (and agreement of the Home Sec) that it would be given out to PCC?s (but on a different basis to that of the ?formula? applied to the police main grant). The Home Sec agreed to this ?top-slice/re-allocation? because Police Chiefs had also agreed to this concept. The primary reason for this top slice was due to the fact that the funding formula would not have allocated control room funding on an appropriate basis. The basis for apportionment was developed by the ESMCP control room manager after consultation with relevant stakeholders in the industry. The police forces therefore need this additional grant funding to allow them to carry out this essential work as funding was deliberately withheld from the main police grant to allow for an alternative method of apportionment.,"37,000,000",01/04/16,31/03/17,1,Formula,Public Organisations,3.

Public order and safetyHome Office,SCH-000002044,Police Transformation Fund (PTF)16-17,"The PTF aims to deliver the mechanisms for policing to continue to transform itself to meet future demands, building the capabilities it needs to respond to changing crimes and threats. Shared platforms and wider and deeper collaboration will become the norm. Back office functions will be delivered more efficiently and there will be better interoperability between different law enforcement organisations. Policing will need to develop a more flexible and representative workforce with the right skills. It will be digitally enabled, more accessible and transparent to the public and be able to share digital information across the Criminal Justice System. There will need to be a greater focus on prevention, safeguarding the vulnerable and supporting victims. There are two distinct phases to the PTF. Phase 1 will include some limited and priority operational uplift. In some of the major areas identified for transformation, notably digital policing, phase 1 will cover the phases of planning and design with proof of concept and trials. This agile approach will enable the police to prepare a business case for national roll out of proven proposals which PCCs and Chief Constables believe are suitable for a national approach, and submit the business case through the police-led PRTB (APCC/NPCC). Phase 1 would also deliver procurement of the new capability. The Home Secretary has already agreed that work on digital capabilities, armed policing and development of the specialist capabilities programme will be funded from Phase 1 and these funds have been prioritised from the PTF. Phase 1 has already been agreed by HMT (please see attached letter). Phase 2 will comprise full implementation of the priorities set through Phase 1 in line with the reform oversight of the APCC and NPCC, through the Police Strategy and Reform Board ensuring delivery at scale. The substantial uplift in the level of funding available in 2018/19 and 2019/20 means the work done in phase 1 will be vital to ensure the new monies are used to maximum benefit. The Home Office has made it clear that access to the fund on the part of forces should not be seen as a right. It should and will be dependent on implementing genuine transformational change. Phase 2 has yet to receive agreement from HMT and officials will work with HMT and agree on Phase 2 before legal cover is sought for this phase in 2018/19.","76,400,000",01/04/16,31/03/17,1,General Grants - Competed,Public Organisations,3.
