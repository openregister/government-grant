# Government-grant register data

Data for a register of government grants, based on a
[dataset](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-grants-register)
on GOV.UK.

There are two things going on here:

* schemes
* awards

The awards seem to use the same identifier as the goverenment-organisation
register.
